# Movie-Recommended-System
The movie recommendation system helps users discover movies similar to their favorites. By selecting a movie from the list, users receive a list of top 10 recommended movies along with their posters. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze the features of movies and find similarities between them. It uses the TMDB API to fetch and display movie posters, enhancing the user experience by providing visual context for the recommendations. The system is built with Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to explore movie recommendations easily.

## __What is a Recommendation System?__<br>
A recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering systems that seek to predict the rating or preference a user would give to an item. They are widely used in various applications like movie recommendations, product recommendations, and content recommendations.

## __Types of Recommendation Systems__<br>
1. Content-Based Filtering: This method recommends items similar to those a user liked in the past. It relies on the attributes of the items and a profile of the user's preferences.
2. Collaborative Filtering: This method recommends items based on the preferences of similar users. It doesn't require the attributes of the items and instead focuses on user-item interactions.
3. Hybrid Methods: These methods combine content-based and collaborative filtering to provide more accurate recommendations.
